Bandit Level 4 â†’ Level 5: Identifying a Human-Readable File
Problem Description:
In this level, you are tasked with finding the password for Bandit5. The password is stored in one of the files in the inhere directory, and your goal is to identify the human-readable file among them.

Solution Steps:
Navigate to the inhere directory: Start by changing to the inhere directory where the files are located.

bash
Copy
cd inhere
Identify the Readable File: The file command helps you identify the type of each file in the directory. Use it to check all files:

bash
Copy
file ./*
This will output the type of each file. You are looking for a file that is labeled as ASCII text, as that will be the human-readable file containing the password.

Read the Correct File: Once you have identified the file that is labeled as ASCII text, use the cat command to display its contents:

bash
Copy
cat ./-file07
Replace ./-file07 with the actual filename of the readable file if it's different. The content of the file will contain the password for Bandit5.

Login to Bandit5: After obtaining the password, you can log into Bandit5 with the following command:

bash
Copy
ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Enter the password you retrieved from the readable file when prompted.
